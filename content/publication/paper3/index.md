abstract = "This research is focused on proposed adaptive fuzzy sliding mode algorithms with the adaptation laws derived in the
Lyapunov sense. The stability of the closed-loop system is proved mathematically based on the Lyapunov method. Adaptive MIMO fuzzy compensate fuzzy sliding mode method design a MIMO fuzzy system to compensate for the model uncertainties of the system, and chattering also solved by new
adaption method. Since there is no tuning method to adjust the
premise part of fuzzy rules so we presented a scheme to online
tune consequence part of fuzzy rules. Classical sliding mode
control is robust to control model uncertainties and external
disturbances. A sliding mode method with a switching control
low guarantees the stability of the certain and/or uncertain
system, but the addition of the switching control low introduces
chattering into the system. One of the main targets in this
research to reduce or eliminate chattering is to insert online
tuning method. Classical sliding mode control method has
difficulty in handling unstructured model uncertainties. One can
overcome this problem by combining a sliding mode controller
and artificial intelligence (e.g. fuzzy logic). To approximate a
time-varying nonlinear dynamic system, a fuzzy system requires
a large amount of fuzzy rule base. This large number of fuzzy
rules will cause a high computation load. The addition of an
adaptive law to a fuzzy sliding mode controller to online tune
the parameters of the fuzzy rules in use will ensure a moderate
computational load. The adaptive laws in this algorithm are
designed based on the Lyapunov stability theorem. Asymptotic
stability of the closed loop system is also proved in the sense of
Lyapunov. This method is applied to continuum robot
manipulator to have the best performance."

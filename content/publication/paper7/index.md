# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "The Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) Fuzzy Sliding Mode Controller (FSMC) is the most widely used control strategy in the Industry (control of robotic arm). The popularity of PID FSMC controllers can be attributed to their robust performance in a wide range of operating conditions and partly to their functional simplicity. The process of setting of PID FSMC controller can be determined as an optimization task. Over the years, use of intelligent strategies for tuning of these controllers has been growing. Biologically inspired evolutionary strategies have gained importance over other strategies because of their consistent performance over wide range of process models and their flexibility. This paper analyses the modified PID FSMC controllers based on minimum rule base for flexible robot manipulator system and test the quality of process control in the simulation environment of MATLAB/SIMULINK Simulator."

abstract = "The minimum rule base Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) Fuzzy Computed Torque Controller is presented in this research. The popularity of PID Fuzzy Computed Torque Controller can be attributed to their robust performance in a wide range of operating conditions and partly to their functional simplicity. The process of setting of PID Fuzzy Computed Torque Controller can be determined as an optimization task. Over the years, use of intelligent strategies for tuning of these controllers has been growing. PID methodology has three inputs and if any input is described with seven linguistic values, and any rule has three conditions we will need 343 rules. It is too much work to write 343 rules. In this research the PID-like fuzzy controller can be constructed as a parallel structure of a PD-like fuzzy controller and a PI controller to have the minimum rule base. However computed torque controller is work based on cancelling decoupling and nonlinear terms of dynamic parameters of each link, this controller is work based on manipulator dynamic model and this technique is highly sensitive to the knowledge of all parameters of nonlinear robot manipulatorâ€™s dynamic equation. This research is used to reduce or eliminate the computed torque controller problem based on minimum rule base fuzzy logic theory to control of flexible robot manipulator system and testing of the quality of process control in the simulation environment of MATLAB/SIMULINK Simulator."

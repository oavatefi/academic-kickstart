I obtained my Master’s degree in Computer Engineering from University of Michigan-Dearborn in 2017, advised by [Prof. Hafiz Malik] (https://umdearborn.edu/users/hafiz). My master's thesis is on Physical-Fingerprinting of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) Based on Machine Learning Algorithm for In-Vehicle Network Communication Protocol “CAN-BUS” (see [here](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/140731/Thesis%20manuscript_v3.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)). 

I worked at [Vector North America](https://www.vector.com/) company as Embedded Software Engineer and currently working at Valeo North America Inc. as Advanced Development Engineer in Research & Development department. During my education at University of Michigan, I was working as researcher at Information System, Security, and Forensics ([ISSF](http://issf.umd.umich.edu/index.html)) lab. Additionally, I was working as primary researcher in the laboratory of Control and Robotics at IRAN-SSP after finishing my Bachelor's program.

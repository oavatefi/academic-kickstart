; VS6 II - FR definition
; To be defined in the fr .ini files:
; 	- Frames
;		- [ParkInfo_FR]==> section name, recomended to use the frame name on the fibex file
;		- type = Frame ==> identifies this section as a Frame definition
;		- slotID = 125 ==> slot Id of the frame being defined. Use to distingish between different Frames
;		- lengthB = 42 ==> length in bytes of the frame
;	- PDU
;		- [ParkInfo_Ft]==> section name, recomended to use the PDU name on the fibex file
;		- type = PDU ==> identifies this section as a PDU definition
;		- lengthB = 8 ==> length in bytes of the PDU
;		- startbit = 16 ==> start bit of the PDU within the Frame. Use to distinghish between different PDUs
;		- byteorder = 0 ==> byte order of the PDU within the Frame
;		- slotID = 125 ==> slot ID of the Frame whom this PDU belongs to
;	- Signal
;		- type = Signal ==> identifies this section as a Signal definition
;		- length = 16 ==> length in bits of the signal
; 		- startbit = 0 ==> start bit of the Signal within the PDU. Use to distingish between different Signals. 
;                          The start bit shall be the less significant bit. In motorola it doesn't match with the start bit from CANOE!!!
;		- byteorder = 0 ==> byte order of the Signal within the PDU
; 		- valuetype = 1 ==> value type of the signal
; 	    - base_cycle ==> base cycle if the signal is multiplexed (can be found within the frame properties)
; 	    - cycle_repetition ==> cycle repetition if the signal is multiplexed (can be found within the frame properties)
;		- startbitPDU = 16 ==> start bit of the PDU whom this Signal belongs to
;		- slotID = 125 ==> slot ID of the Frame whom this Signal belongs to
;		- dataName = odom_x_mm ==> name to link the signal with a visualization in VS6
